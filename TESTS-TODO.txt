# The following tests need to be added to TestRelation.cfc in order
# to make sure query, query-of-query, and datasource functionality all
# work as expected. A custom testing datasource / table structure needs
# to be created in order to fully test querying.

# new variables
this.datasource
variables.query
variables.result
variables.executed

# new cloning logic
clone()

# lazy query logic
exec()
reload()
query()
result()

# query-of-query
qoq()

# automatic clone() or qoq() calls in
select(), distinct(), where(), group(),
having(), order(), limit(), offset()
